Buildout of a Photoshop design from a Lynda.com Tutorial found [here](https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Welcome/145211/166592-4.html?autoplay=true).

This is my first buildout of a webpage. I took this tutorial to learn Photoshop. I wrote about it on a [blog post](http://meredal.github.io/PhotoshopCC-15/) and then created a new repository for the buildout. There are some pieces missing, but will be added as I learn Javascript in the near future. The only place to currently view the webpage is through this repo, but it will eventually be added to my blog.
